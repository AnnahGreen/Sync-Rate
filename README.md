# Sync-Rate
Repository for the game Sync-Rate.

“Sync-Rate” is an action platformer, beat-em up, and first person shooter. It is a linear, story driven, level based game. 

The goal of the game is to collect all upgrades and achieve complete sync. Each level is based around sync level (your upgrades) and will be a perfect playground for your abilities.

As players progress more they receive sync points. Sync points are used to upgrade suits and unlock new capabilities.

“Sync-Rate” has two distinct styles of play: The player can interchange between first and third person perspective. This is done with a simple aim down sights (ADS). When infiltrating indoor areas, the player may be forced to a tighter first person perspective for immersion and accessibility. In more open areas perspective is controlled at the player’s discretion.
